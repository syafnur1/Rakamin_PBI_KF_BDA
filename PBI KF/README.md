## Project Background 
Kimia Farma is the first pharmaceutical industry company in Indonesia which was founded by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. As a Big Data Analytics Intern at Kimia Farma, our duties will include a deep understanding of data and analytical skills. One of your main projects is evaluating Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023

## Data Preparation
Before starting data processing, the first step that must be done is to prepare raw data into structured data and ready to be processed. Here's what I do at Data Preparation Stage:

1. Download datasets given
2. Create a new database and tables in **Google BigQuery** for the prepared datasets by adjusting the data type of each column, also arranging Primary Keys and Foreign Keys for each table
3. Importing csv data into the database
4. Create entity relationships between tables based on the structure in the "Data Relationship"

  ```sql

-- Create new schema -- 
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS `canvas-bot-415513.kimia_farma`;

-- Create table from dataset --
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `canvas-bot-415513.kimia_farma.final_transaction`
(
	transaction_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
	date DATE,
	branch_id INT64,
	customer_name STRING,
    product_id INT64, 
    price INT64,
    discount_percentage FLOAT64,
    rating FLOAT64
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `canvas-bot-415513.kimia_farma.inventory`
(
	Inventory_ID STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_id INT64,
    product_id INT64,
    product_name STRING,
    opname_stock INT64
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `canvas-bot-415513.kimia_farma.kantor_cabang`
(
	branch_id INT64 PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_category	STRING,
    branch_name	STRING,
    kota STRING,
    provinsi STRING,
    rating FLOAT64
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `canvas-bot-415513.kimia_farma.product`
(
	product_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name STRING,
    product_category STRING,
    price INT64
);

## Analysis Table
Before designing sales dashboard, I will create datamart from previously made raw data, consisting of base and aggregate tables using Google BigQuery.

## Task 03 : Dashboard Design
After designing Datamart from raw data, I built Performance Analytics Dashboard based on the aggregate tables previously created. For Interactive Dasboard please click  <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9fcc68e1-58e6-4d36-a33c-3a89f6f16c6c">this link</a>

</p>

From the dashboard, some insights can be seen as follows:
- Total sales were 321,2 B, 31 provinces, 70 cities, and 1725 branches
- There has been a fluctuation in sales over the past four years and a peak in 2022 at 80.5 B.
- The top 10 transactions and sales by province remain the same, Jawa Barat, Sumatera Utara, Jawa Tengah, Jawa Timur, Sulawesi Utara, and so on.
<br>

Recommendation can be converted into marketing strategies as below:
- Focus marketing efforts on provinces with consistently high sales, then product offerings tailored to these regions to maintain and potentially increase market share.
- Leverage digital marketing channels such as social media, email marketing, and online advertising to reach a wider audience and drive online and offline sales.
- With 1725 branches across 31 provinces and 70 cities, consider expanding branch presence strategically, focusing on areas with high growth potential or underserved markets. This can help increase accessibility and convenience for customers, leading to higher sales.
